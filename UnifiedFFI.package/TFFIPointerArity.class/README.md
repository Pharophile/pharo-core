I define common behaviour for determine arity processing for different kind of FFI types who are actually pointers inside, as handlers. Take for example: - ExternalAddress, ByteArray, FFIOop, FFIVoid*,  FFIExternalObjectType, FFIExternalStructureType -> This are equivallent to void*- FFICharacter *, FFIExternalString -> This are equivallent to char*If passed with a bigger arity than 1 (==void **==, for example), that means they require to be rolled into pointers (pointers pointing to them).This is the equivallent of the C function (for example):[ [ [  void *x = NULL; //or malloc(42);void **px = &x ;] ] ]Which is often used in C frameworks.
