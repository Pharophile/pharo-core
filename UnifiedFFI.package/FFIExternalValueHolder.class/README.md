I am a generic meta class for creating a subclasses, which instances will hold a single value of specified C type.To create a new class for some concrete C type you need to extend me and indicate the type you want to use:FFIExternalTypeValue subclass: FFIFloatValueHolder.FFIInt64ValueHolder>>type 	^ FFIFloat32Then you can use instances of given class(es) as a value holders fortype you specified:float := FFIFloatValueHolder new....float value:  1.5float valueetc..By combining this with class/pool variables we have a convenient way of defining a values, which are passed by pointer to a function.For instance, imagine that we need to create a binding to a function:void getFoo( SomeType * value) which is not an unusual situation, when C function using pointer arguments for storing it's output there.And this is what FFIExternalValueHolder is done for. To define a binding to this function you can declare a subclass named SomeType and then use it in function signature:getFoo: value  ^ self ffiCall: #(void getFoo ( SomeType *  value ))---and call it like: var := SomeType new.self getFoo: var.var value -> will read the value
