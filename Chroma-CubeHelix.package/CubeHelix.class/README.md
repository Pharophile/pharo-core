My instances represent a color gradient in the CubeHelix family.	CubeHelix new at: someValueBetweenZeroAndOneCubeHelix is a formula for color gradients which ensure a continuous increase in perceived intensity from black to white, with hue variations that increase  by following a tapered spiral around the diagonal of the RGB color cube. Converting the gradient back to grayscale produces a linear gradient.See http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~dag/CUBEHELIX/
