I'm an implementation of a table, in a not-naive way. I assume I can have many rows, then I do not try to show all of them at once. Instead, I keep a datasource and I demand rows when needed (datasource implements a flyweight to fill the visible rows).Examples: -------------FTTableMorph new	extent: 200@400;	dataSource: (FTSimpleDataSource elements: (1 to: 10000) );	openInWindow.	You can check better examples in FTExamples
