A RBAddRemoveDependentsRule is a rule related to the notion of object dependencies. It checks that the number of addDependent: message sends in a class is less than or equal to the number of removeDependent: messages. If there are more addDependent: messages that may signify that some dependents are not being released, which may lead to memory leaks.
