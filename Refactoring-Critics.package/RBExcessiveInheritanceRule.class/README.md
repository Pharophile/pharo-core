This smell arises when a deep inheritance is found (depth of ten or more). This is usually a sign of a design flaw. It should be broken down and reduced to something manageable. 
Several possibilities can occur. Here are some hints: check whether some classes in the hierarchy just do not add enough behavior to require a class in itself, check whether all the classes are root of a kind of little inheritance hierarchy. Note that often a framework may define already a certain level of inheritance and the user code may add another layers. This rule does not take frameworks into account.
