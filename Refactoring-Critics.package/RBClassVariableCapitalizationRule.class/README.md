This smell arises when class or pool variable names do not start with an uppercase letter, which is a standart style in Smalltalk. In fact a lowercase is used to represent variables with a local scope such as instance variables, temporary variables, method and block arguments. Uppercase is used to represent the case where the scope of a variable is either global (class name and global variables such Transcript) or shared mong different classes (class variables or pool variables).
