I, with my friends (MacPixPatPtr, MacPoint and MacRGBColor), show how to make calls into a Mac OS framework.The particular library I use in my examples, QuickDraw, is depreciated in OS X 10.4, but the examples still run as of OS X 10.6.2See http://developer.apple.com/legacy/mac/library/documentation/Carbon/Reference/QuickDraw_Ref/Reference/reference.html for more information.WARNING: for Snow Leopard, see warning in MacOSShell
