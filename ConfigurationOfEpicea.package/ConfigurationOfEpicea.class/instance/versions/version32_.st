			- Order the entries for redo and undo operations using the timestamp. 
				(Much better than using the user selection order).
			- Implemented #asEpiceaRingDefinition in metamodel and ring definitions. 
				The advantages are: 
				- Store package name always, instead of either nil or the RPackage.
				- Huge speed up in ChangeSet importation since it was storing parent of the methods.
				- It is possible to Redo or Undo an event imported from a ChangeSet (it was almost impossible).
				- Also do not store #passive annotation on each method, which saves a bit of space.
