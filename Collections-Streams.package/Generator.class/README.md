A Generator transforms callback interfaces into stream interfaces. When a producer algorithm provide results as callbacks (blocks) and a consumer algorithm expects streamable input, a Generator transforms one into the other. See class-side examples.Instance Variables	block:		<BlockClosure> The block associated with the generator.	continue:	<MethodContext>	The continuation to return to.	home:		<MethodContext>	The home (root) context of the activated block	next:		<Object>		The next object to return from the Generator.
