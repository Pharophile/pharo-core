A PointPair class is pair of points. The astute reader can wonder why this class exists when we have Rectangle.A rectangle can be defined using different ways and not only a pair of points and in addition a rectangle has a strong invariant: its height and width must not be negative: the top-left point is always less or equals than bottom right one. A pair of points can be used to specify situations that could not be with rectangles. For example if you want to inset a rectangle corners by different offsets, without pair of points you may be forced to use a rectangle violating the invariant.rec1 insetBy: (0@50 corner: 10@10)is not correctwhile rec1 insetBy: (0@50 pair: 10@10)is correct.
