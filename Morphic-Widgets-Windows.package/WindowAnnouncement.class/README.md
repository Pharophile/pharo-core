I am the base class for all WindowAnnouncementsI define the common interface for WindowAnnouncements. You can check the type of the announcement (isMoved/isScrolled ...)My subclasses implement the specific window announcements and may provide further states.Implementation PointsThe window event is one of my instance vars , although not all possible WindowAnnouncements may be triggeredby a window event. (Maybe this should be refactored out)
