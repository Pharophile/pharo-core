I'm a MorphTreeModel enriched with a filter text field. When a pattern is entered in the textfield, then only appropriate root items are drawn in the tree. Very useful to filter a list of items. This model should be used everywhere a filter is added on top of a list as in NautilusExample:	| window m |	window := StandardWindow new model: self.	window title: 'Test runner'.	m := FilteredMorphTreeModel new		wrapBlockOrSelector: #selector;		rootItems: Morph methods.	window addMorph: (m defaultDialogMorphIn: window) fullFrame: LayoutFrame identity.	window openInWorldInternal Representation and Key Implementation Points.    Instance Variables	ghostString:		<String>	initialItems:		<Collection>	patternModel:		<RubScrolledTextModel>
