Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:For the Class part:  State a one line summary. For example, "I represent a paragraph of text".For the Responsibility part: Three sentences about my main responsibilities - what I do, what I know.For the Collaborators Part: State my main collaborators and one line about how I interact with them. Public API and Key Messages- message one   - message two - (for bonus points) how to create instances.   One simple example is simply gorgeous. Internal Representation and Key Implementation Points.    Instance Variables	announcer:		<Object>	firstVisiblePageIndex:		<Object>	focusedMorphs:		<Object>	focusedPageIndex:		<Object>	isDependenciesShown:		<Object>	isNotificationsAllowed:		<Object>	lastVisiblePageIndex:		<Object>	minimumPageNumberForScrollbar:		<Object>	numberOfVisiblePages:		<Object>	pagesCount:		<Object>	scrollButtonIconRenderBlock:		<Object>	scrollToRightTask:		<Object>	scrollingDelay:		<Object>	selectedPageIndex:		<Object>	virtualFirstVisiblePageIndex:		<Object>	virtualLastVisiblePageIndex:		<Object>    Implementation Points
