I represent a single text line, which belongs to specific layout.I carry various geometrical information, such as maximum ascent, line height and width.My commands are TxDisplayCommand-s which contain enough information to renderthe line correctly on canvas , as well as for measuring font metrics.I am certainly not the top level API and my implementation is considered private(in contrast to LayoutView).
