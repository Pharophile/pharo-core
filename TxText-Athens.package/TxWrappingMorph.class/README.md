Any morphs embedded in the text should use me as a wrapper.This class is private (you are not supposed to create its instances by yourself).This morph wraps a user morph, embedded in a text,and provides some helpers for the morph's positioning etc.An example of using an embedded object can be found in #exampleWithEmbeddedObjectTo insert sanembedded object send #insertObject: to a text position, for example:text endPosition insertObject: 123.
