I represent a view of portion of text, laid out using specified layout strategy.The view is defined using following inputs:- position in text- view extent (width and height)- surface, which will be used to render the view.I support rendering via #renderOn: method, as well as translating between view point and text position (but only in the area of view itself).The surface is responsible for providing the font renderer,which is used to measure text metrics and lay it out properlyusing specified strategy and keep synchronized with what rendererwill produce on surface.Please note, that view's layout is computed only for a portion of text (unless text fully fits into it), just neccessary to display an area visible through view,which makes the view completely independent from the size of text.The text layout needs to be adjusted/reset when following variables changed:  - a view's text position changed - view scrolled up/down (which indirectly changes view's text position) - text is modified - layout strategy is changed - drawing surface is changed
