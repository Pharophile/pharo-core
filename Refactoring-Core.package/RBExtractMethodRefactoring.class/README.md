I am a refactoring for creating a method from a code fragment.You can select an interval of some code in a method and call this refactoring to create a new method implmenting that code and replace the code by calling that function. The new method needs to have as the number of arguments, the number of (temp)variables, the code refers to.The preconditions are quite complex. The code needs to be parseable valid code.
