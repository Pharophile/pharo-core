This font can then be used with cairo_set_font_face() or cairo_scaled_font_create(). The cairo_scaled_font_t returned from cairo_scaled_font_create() is also for the FreeType backend and can be used with functions such as cairo_ft_scaled_font_lock_face(). Note that Cairo may keep a reference to the FT_Face alive in a font-cache and the exact lifetime of the reference depends highly upon the exact usage pattern and is subject to external factors. You must not call FT_Done_Face() before the last reference to the cairo_font_face_t has been dropped. "		^ (self primFtFace: aFace  loadFlags: flags) initialize
