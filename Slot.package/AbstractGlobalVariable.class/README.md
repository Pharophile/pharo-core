I am a meta object for global viriables.I am just a subclass of Association, modeling the binding of the global in either the Smalltalk globals, Undeclared or classPools.You can subclass me and implement #read and #write: for creating special kindsof globals that can be used as special class Variables (similar to special Slots).TAKE CARE: you can not add instance variables when you make subclasses for special globals!!!(later we will provide a special slot that saves the state in a class side registry)
