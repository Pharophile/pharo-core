I am a specialized read-only stream, intended to work with text in order to extract characters out of it. Since text model can hold not just characters, but any sort of objects, which not necessary can be represented by character(s),this stream can be used to filter only character data.Please note, that if you will attempt to modify text while using this stream,the results may be vary, since any modification of text invalidates all positions, held externally, and not maintained implicitly during text modification operations (like selection does).Thus, special care must be taken to reinitialize the stream's position to valid  position after modifying the subject text.Handling the position updates is, of course, not the responsibility of this classs, since it cannot know, nor predict, what kind of modification it may be and where it will occur and how it will affect the position it holds.The only responsibility of this class is provide a convenient stream for reading character data from text.
