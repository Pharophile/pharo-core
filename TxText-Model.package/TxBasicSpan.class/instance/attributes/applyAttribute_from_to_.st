applyAttribute: anAttribute from: startPosition to: endPosition
	
	"
	If startPosition does not point to the receiver, it means the start of the span covered by the attribute,
	if endPosition does not point to the receiver, it means the end of span covered by attribute.
	
	Else, they define a split point.
	
	4 cases: 
		- span already has given attribute (so do nothing )
		- start/end covers entire span (just add attribute)
		- split on 2 spans if start or end is at end of span 
		- split on 3 spans both start and end in the middle or span
