I am abtract class, representing a portion of text (span).I form a double-linked list with my neighbour spans and full list as result form the contents of text.Spans could have attributes and size. Size determines the number of positions which span can contain (number of positions is always = size +1).For instance a character span with 2 characters 'AB' , can have 3 different positions: |AB A|B AB|where '|' showing the position in span and ranged from 0 to 2.Like that TxTextPosition can navigate inside a span (using moveLeft/moveRight commands),without actually needing to deal with strings, characters or anything else.
