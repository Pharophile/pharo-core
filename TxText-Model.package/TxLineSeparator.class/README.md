i representing a line separator(NOT a new line in text).My size is always 1. And my textual representation is always Character cr.I have only two valid span positions: 0 - denotes the last valid position of previous line (line end) 1 - denotes the first valid position of next line (line start).My attributes defining the default attributes of the new line, so even if next spanis a line separator (meaning that next line is empty), i can provide information for visual properties such as line height etc.
