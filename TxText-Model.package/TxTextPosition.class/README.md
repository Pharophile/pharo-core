I represent position inside a text. I am immutable.I'm characterized by a span and position inside span.Usually, one do not specify absolute positioning in text (using textIndex accessors),but instead a relative, by starting from some known point (like already known position, or text start/end),and navigating to desired position using the navigation protocol (moveLeft/moveRight etc). I provide operations to 	- query the position in a text (isAtEnd, isAtStart, isValid)	- compute new position relative to existing one (moveToLeft: 3, moveToUp)	- insert new text (#insert: ) or embedded object (#insertObject:).	I can also give access to absolute positioning in text using #asTextIndex accessors,but they are much slower/ineffective comparing to relative positioning, and should not be used unless ultimately necessary.
