I'm the entry point of the session (betwen start/save/stop) management mechanism.I replace the old startup and shutdown list mechanism.There is a default instance of me used by the system accessible through:	self default.I can create new sessions and manage categories.I also provide a facade to register new session handlers.I can provide the list of handlers by order of priority (categories order and categories priority) either for the startup or the shutdown.	self default startupList.	self default shutdownList.Note: the shutdown list is just the startup list reversed
