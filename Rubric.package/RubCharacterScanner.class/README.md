Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:For the Class part:  State a one line summary. For example, "I represent a paragraph of text".For the Responsibility part: Three sentences about my main responsibilities - what I do, what I know.For the Collaborators Part: State my main collaborators and one line about how I interact with them. Public API and Key Messages- message one   - message two - (for bonus points) how to create instances.   One simple example is simply gorgeous. Internal Representation and Key Implementation Points.    Instance Variables	alignment:		<Object>	baselineY:		<Object>	destX:		<Object>	destY:		<Object>	emphasisCode:		<Object>	firstDestX:		<Object>	font:		<Object>	indentationLevel:		<Object>	kern:		<Object>	lastIndex:		<Object>	leftMargin:		<Object>	line:		<Object>	pendingKernX:		<Object>	rightMargin:		<Object>	runStopIndex:		<Object>	spaceCount:		<Object>	spaceWidth:		<Object>	stopConditions:		<Object>	text:		<Object>	textStyle:		<Object>    Implementation Points
