I provide the capability to edit a StringMorph in place.Shift+mouseDown on the StringMorph to activate the editor. Escape to abort. The edition is aborted if the keyboard focus is lost or in case of a mouse down everywhere else than inside the editor.The Enter key or Cmd+s save the contents in the StringMorph, then I send an announcement of class RubStringMorphContentsEdited so that the changed StringMorph owner can take action.see #exampleEditableStringMorph class side Internal Representation and Key Implementation Points.Instance Variables	announcer:		<computeAnnouncerObjects >	editor:		<RubScrolledTextMorph>	stringMorph:		<StringMorph>
