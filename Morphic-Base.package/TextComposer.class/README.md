Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:For the Class part:  State the name of the class with one line description: For example, I'm xxx the root of the hierarchy of visitor objects.For the Responsibility part: Three sentences about my main responsibility, what I'm doing, what services do I offer.For the Collaborators Part: State my main collaborators and one line about how I interact with them. Public API and Key Messages- message one   - message two - what is the way to create instances is a plus.   One simple example is simply gorgeous. Internal Representation and Key Implementation Points.    Instance Variables	actualHeight:		<Object>	currCharIndex:		<Object>	currentY:		<Object>	defaultLineHeight:		<Object>	deltaCharIndex:		<Object>	isFirstLine:		<Object>	lines:		<Object>	maxRightX:		<Object>	nowSliding:		<Object>	possibleSlide:		<Object>	prevIndex:		<Object>	prevLines:		<Object>	scanner:		<Object>	startCharIndex:		<Object>	stopCharIndex:		<Object>	theContainer:		<Object>	theText:		<Object>	theTextStyle:		<Object>	wantsColumnBreaks:		<Object>    Implementation Points
