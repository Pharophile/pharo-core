Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:For the Class part:  State a one line summary. For example, "I represent a paragraph of text".For the Responsibility part: Three sentences about my main responsibilities - what I do, what I know.For the Collaborators Part: State my main collaborators and one line about how I interact with them. Public API and Key Messages- message one   - message two - (for bonus points) how to create instances.   One simple example is simply gorgeous. Internal Representation and Key Implementation Points.    Instance Variables	acceptAction:		<Object>	acceptOnFocusChange:		<Object>	alwaysAccept:		<Object>	askBeforeDiscardingEdits:		<Object>	autoAccept:		<Object>	changedAction:		<Object>	doubleClickSelector:		<Object>	enabled:		<Object>	getColorSelector:		<Object>	getEnabledSelector:		<Object>	getSelectionSelector:		<Object>	getTextSelector:		<Object>	hasEditingConflicts:		<Object>	hasUnacceptedEdits:		<Object>	highlights:		<Object>	selectionColor:		<Object>	selectionInterval:		<Object>	setSelectionSelector:		<Object>	setTextSelector:		<Object>	styler:		<Object>	textMorph:		<Object>	unstyledAcceptText:		<Object>    Implementation Points
