session	"Answer the current session object.	Currently, there is no assumptions about what protocol(s) a session object should conform to.	The only valid use of session object is to compare it using identity comparison, i.e. #== 	with another session object retrieved before, in order to detect session change. 		A session changes every time image boots from disk. It doesn't changes on snapshot.	"	^ session ifNil: [ session := self newSessionObject ].
