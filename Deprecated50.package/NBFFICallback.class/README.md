I'm a stub class intended just to easy migration from NB to UFFI. The corresponding class to replace me is: FFICallback.MIGRATION NOTES: Translation from old NB callbacks to UFFI callbacks is not  authomatic, but is fairly easy: you do not need to extend callbacks, instead, you just declare your callbacks as something like: callback := FFICallback	signature:  #(int (const void *arg1, const void *arg2))	block: [ :arg1 :arg2 | ((arg1 doubleAt: 1) - (arg2 doubleAt: 1)) sign ].
