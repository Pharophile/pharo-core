I'm a stub class intended just to easy migration from NB to UFFI. The corresponding class to replace me is: FFIExternalStructure.MIGRATION NOTES: Structures in UFFI are very different to NB ones, but not much changes should be necessary. One important change is the fact that accessors are not installed dynamically anymore, instead, we recommend you to execute ==MyStructure rebuildFieldAccessors== once to have access to fields.
