A GTSpotterEventRecorder provides the main functionality for recording and sending usage data in Spotter. The collection and delivery works as follows:- the recorder registers with Spotter every time Spotter is opened ;- as long as the setting #sendUsageData is set to false all events received by the recorder are discarded;- the first time an event is send to the recorder and the setting#sendUsageData is set to true a delivery process is started- as long as the setting #sendUsageData is set to true all interesting events received by the recorder are stored- at certain intervals the delivery process collects all data, compressed it, and places a payload to a delivery queue.- the delivery process takes the next paylod from the queue and attepts to send it to a server; on sucsess the payload is removed from the queue.- if the setting #sendUsageData is set to false, events are no longer collected and all recorded data is removed next time the delivery process resumes.The delivery process is not stopped by default after creation. The class size method #cleanUp stops the delivery process and removes all data that still awaits delivery.Instance Variables	deliveryDelay:		<Object>	deliveryQueue:		<Object>	mutex:		<Object>	process:		<Object>	recordedData:		<Object>	shouldDeliver:		<Object>deliveryDelay	- xxxxxdeliveryQueue	- xxxxxmutex	- xxxxxprocess	- xxxxxrecordedData	- xxxxxshouldDeliver	- xxxxx
