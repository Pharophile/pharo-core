DelayExperimentalCourageousScheduler addresses a "Delay scheduling deadlock" problem of Case 14344 [1] seemingly due to multi-thread suspend/resume operations interacting badly with background morphs, causing the Image to lock up.  See the class comment of DelaySchedulerBackgroundWorkerMorph.My #schedule: and #unschedule: methods pass Delays from the user priority threads to the high priority #handleTimerEvent thread via  instance variables /scheduledDelay/ and /finishedDelay/.   The original implementation used mutexes to protect these in a shared-memory paradigm.   However immediately after assigning those variables, #signal invokes the highest priority thread to consume the set value, so we speculate that even without interthread synchronisation, the variables cannot be overwritten by another thread."		This is quite speculative and due to limited time to test prior to Pharo 4 Release, I am very "experimental."  Use at own risk. I can be selected via "World > System > Settings > Setting > Delay scheduler".To compare the different delay schedulers...   1.   "World > Tools > Process Browser", and set to auto-update.   2.   Transcript open.   3.   DelayBenchmark runAll.
