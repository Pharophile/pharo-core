I handle the high "timing" priority process that interacts with the VM scheduled timing sempahore to manage scheduling of Delays.  This is essentially the original code refactored from the pre-2014 class-side of Delay.  This was further refactored into two subclasses... * DelayMillisecondScheduler (same as original, 6 day clock rollover) * DelayMicrosecondScheduler (new, 50,000 year rollover)...but this original code has been kept to ease the integration transition to the new code.  A fair amount of code is duplicated in the subclasses for both performance and helping with the live transition to the new code (some cleanup required after the new code has been in use for a while)You can change between DelayScheduler implementations from Settings Browser > System.This is THE highest priority code which is run in Pharo, in other words it is time-critical. The speed of this code is critical for accurate responses, it is critical for network services, it affects every last part of the system.A word of advice:Don't fix it if it ain't broken! This code isn't supposed to be beautiful, it's supposed to be fast! The reason for duplicating code is to make it fast. The reason for not using ifNil:[]ifNotNil:[] is that the compiler may not inline those. Since the effect of changes are VERY hard to predict it is best to leave things as they are for now unless there is an actual need to change anything.DelayBenchmark provides a means for evaluating alternative schedulers.
