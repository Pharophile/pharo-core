My sole purpose is to hold two instance variables:- a buffer (that must be a valid instance of var-byte or var-words object)- an offset (that must be a small int).NOTE, that offset is ZERO-based. (1-st byte in buffer has 0 offset, second - 1 and so on).I can be used directly as type in external function signature to designate thatcertain argument must take instances of me and convert into single address , pointingat specified offset in my buffer.Example:1. function signature:callSomeFunction: buf	^ self nbCall: 'void someFunction ( NBBufferWithOffset buf )'2. Using: buf := NBBufferWithOffset new buffer: (ByteArray new: 10); offset: 5.self callSomeFunction: buf.
