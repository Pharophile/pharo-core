This marshaller implements support for passing combined buffer + offset address  to external function.It converts an object that should be instance of special class, having two instancevariables named buffer and offset, into a single address as result of marshalling.The buffer ivar must hold a valid instance of variable-byte or variable-word object.The offset ivar should be a non-negative small integer.Note that this type works only for argument conversion and only for value type.
